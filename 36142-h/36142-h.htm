<h2 class="sans">THE ADVENTURES OF PICKLOCK HOLES.</h2>

<h4>(<i>By Cunnin Toil.</i>)</h4>

<h3>No. III.&mdash;LADY HILDA'S MYSTERY.</h3>

<p>A day or two after the stirring events which I have related as
taking place at Blobley-in-the-Marsh, and of which, it will be remembered,
I was myself an astonished spectator, I happened to be
travelling, partly for business, partly for pleasure, through one of
the most precipitous of the inaccessible mountain-ranges of
Bokhara. It is unnecessary for me to state in detail the reasons
that had induced me once more to go so far a-field. One of the
primary elements in a physician's success in his career is, that he
should be able to guard, under a veil of impenetrable silence, the
secrets confided to his care. It cannot, therefore, be expected of me
that I should reveal why his Eminence the Cardinal <span class="sc">Dacapo</span>, one of
the most illustrious of the Princes of the Church, desired that I
should set off to Bokhara. When the memoirs of the present
time come to be published, it is possible that no chapter of
them will give rise to bitterer discussion than that which narrates
the interview of the redoubtable Cardinal with the humble author of
this story. Enough, however, of this, at present. On some future
occasion much more will have to be said about it. I cannot endure
to be for ever the scape-goat of the great, and, if the Cardinal
persists in his refusal to do me
justice, I shall have, in the last
resort, to tell the whole truth about
one of the strangest affairs that ever
furnished gossip for all the most
brilliant and aristocratic tea-tables
of the Metropolis.</p>

<p>I was walking along the narrow
mountain path that leads from
Balkh to Samarcand. In my right
hand I held my trusty kirghiz,
which I had sharpened only that
very morning. My head was
shaded from the blazing sun by a
broad native mollah, presented to
me by the Khan of <span class="sc">Bokhara</span>, with
whom I had spent the previous
day in his Highness's magnificent
marble and alabaster palace. As
I walked I could not but be sensible
of a curiously strained and
tense feeling in the air&mdash;the sort of
atmosphere that seems to be, to me
at least, the invariable concomitant
of country-house guessing-games.
I was at a loss to account
for this most curious phenomenon,
when, looking up suddenly, I saw
on the top of an elevated crag in
front of me the solitary and impassive
figure of <span class="sc">Picklock Holes</span>,
who was at that moment engaged
on one of his most brilliant feats
of induction. He evinced no surprise whatever at seeing me. A
cold smile lingered for a moment on his firm and secretive lips, and
he laid the tips of his fingers together in his favourite attitude of
deep consideration.</p>

<p>"How are you, my dear <span class="sc">Potson</span>?" he began. "What? not
well? Dear me, dear me, what can it mean? And yet I don't
think it can have been the fifth glass of sherbet which you took with
the fourteenth wife of the <span class="sc">Khan</span>. No, I don't think it can have
been that."</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Holes</span>, you extraordinary creature," I broke in; "what on earth
made you think that I drank five glasses of sherbert with the <span class="sc">Khan's</span>
fourteenth wife?"</p>

<p>"Nothing simpler, my dear fellow. Just before I saw you a native
Bokharan goose ran past this rock, making, as it passed, a strange
hissing noise, exactly like the noise made by sherbert when
immersed in water. Five minutes elapsed, and then you appeared.
I watched you carefully. Your lips moved, as lips move only when
they pronounce the word fourteen. You then smiled and scratched
your face, from which I immediately concluded you were thinking
of a wife or wives. Do you follow me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, perfectly," I answered, overjoyed to be able to say
so without deviating from the truth; for in following his reasoning
I did not admit its accuracy. As to that I said nothing, for I had
drunk sherbert with no one, and consequently had not taken five
glasses with the fourteenth wife of the <span class="sc">Khan</span>. Still, it was a
glorious piece of guess-work on the part of my matchless friend,
and I expressed my admiration for his powers in no measured
terms.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, after a pause, "you are wondering
why I am here. I will tell you. You know Lady <span class="sc">Hilda Cardamums</span>?"</p>

<p>"What, the third and loveliest daughter of the Marquis of
<span class="sc">Sassafras</span>?"</p>

<p>"The same. Two days ago she left her boudoir at Sassafras
Court, saying that she would return in a quarter of an hour. A
quarter of an hour elapsed, the Lady <span class="sc">Hilda</span> was still absent. The
whole household was plunged in grief, and every kind of surmise was
indulged in to account for the lovely girl's disappearance. Under
these circumstances the Marquis sent for me, and that," said
<span class="sc">Holes</span>, "is why I am here."</p>

<p>"But," I ventured to remark, "do you really expect to find
Lady <span class="sc">Hilda</span> here in Bokhara, on these inhospitable precipices,
where even the wandering Bactrian finds his footing insecure?
Surely it cannot be that you have tracked the Lady <span class="sc">Hilda</span>
hither?"</p>

<p>"Tush," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, smiling in spite of himself at my vehemence.
"Why should she not be here? Listen. She was not at Sassafras Court.
Therefore, she must have been outside Sassafras Court.
Now in Bokhara <i>is</i> outside Sassafras Court, or, to put it
algebraically,</p>

<p class="ind1">in Bokhara = outside Sassafras Court.</p>

<p>Substitute 'in Bokhara' for 'outside Sassafras Court,' and you get
this result&mdash;</p>

<p>'She must have been in Bokhara.'</p>

<p>Do you see any flaw in my
reasoning?"</p>

<p>For a moment I was unable to
answer. The boldness and originality
of this master-mind had as
usual taken my breath away.
<span class="sc">Holes</span> observed my emotion with
sympathy.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my dear fellow!"
he said; "try not to be too much
overcome. Of course, I know it
is not everybody who could track
the mazes of a mystery so promptly;
but, after all, by this time you of
all people in the world ought to have
grown accustomed to my ways.
However, we must not linger here
any longer. It is time for us to restore
Lady <span class="sc">Hilda</span> to her parents."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/085-800.png"><img src="images/085-300.png" width="300" height="319" alt="'Holes opened it, and read it.'" /></a>
<p class="center">"Holes opened it, and read it."</p></div>

<p>As <span class="sc">Holes</span> uttered these words
a remarkable thing happened.
Round the corner of the crag on
which we were standing came a
little native Bokharan telegraph
boy. He approached <span class="sc">Holes</span>, salaamed
deferentially, and handed
him a telegram. <span class="sc">Holes</span> opened it,
and read it without moving a
muscle, and then handed it to me.
This is what I read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind1">"<i>To <span class="sc">Holes</span>, Bokhara.</i></p>

<p class="ind">
"<i><span class="sc">Hilda</span> returned five minutes after you left. Her watch had
stopped. Deeply grateful to you for all your trouble. <span class="sc">Sassafras.</span></i>"
</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, broken by <span class="sc">Holes</span>.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "we must not blame the Lady <span class="sc">Hilda</span> for being
at Sassafras Court and not in Bokhara. After all, she is young and
necessarily thoughtless."</p>

<p>"Still, <span class="sc">Holes</span>," I retorted, with some natural indignation, "I
cannot understand how, after your convincing induction, a
girl of any delicacy of feeling can have remained away from
Bokhara."</p>

<p>"I knew she would do so," said my friend, calmly.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Holes</span>, you are more wonderful than ever," was all that I
could murmur. So that is the true story of Lady <span class="sc">Hilda Cardamums'</span>
return to her family.</p>

<h3>DANGER!</h3>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>In our London streets, for native or stranger,</p>
<p>We ought to have notice-boards warning of "Danger!"</p>
<p>Like those on the Thames near the weirs and locks.</p>
<p>When Premiers collide, and when Princes get shocks,</p>
<p>In cabs or in carriages, King Street way driving,</p>
<p>'Tis time that street warnings the wise were contriving.</p>
<p>For now it is clear that you might as well try</p>
<p>To steer a balloon through a thundery sky,</p>
<p>Or take a stroll near the setting of sun</p>
<p>In a suburb where cads upon bicycles run;</p>
<p>Or command&mdash;or serve in&mdash;an ironclad fleet,</p>

<h2>TRUMPS FOR TRAMPS.</h2>

<h4>(<i>From the Story of a Much-considered Nothing.</i>)</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/087b-500.png"><img src="images/087b-200.png" width="200" height="293" alt="Trumps for Tramps." /></a></div>

<p>THE Tramp was distinctly one of the Unemployed.
He had no money, no friends, no
home. He had obtained some work a short
while since. The labour, of course, had been
unskilled, and then there had come a strike,
and the Tramp and his mates had turned out
with the rest. The Tramp was a little annoyed,
as he had been fairly satisfied to earn bread
and butter and meat, and above all, and before
all, beer. But the leaders of the strike had
satisfied him that it was entirely for his benefit.
That as the Tramp could not work up to their
standard, it was their duty to work down to
his&mdash;and yet get paid at the same rate of
wages belonging to the higher scale. This
seemed to the Tramp pleasant enough. But
while he waited, he starved; so he was not
sure that the notion of the strike was so excellent
after all. But then his brain might have
been clearer&mdash;it had not been fed (in common
with the rest of his body) for several days.</p>

<p>So the Tramp&mdash;weary, ragged, and tanned&mdash;wandered
to the spot where Labour was
holding her Congress. The last meeting had
been held, and the final squabble settled when
he reached his destination. There were a
couple of well-fed, healthy-looking men,
dressed in good strong broad-cloth, standing
outside the meeting-place. They regarded
the Tramp with some surprise.</p>

<p>"Surely not a Member?" said the first.</p>

<p>"And of course not a Delegate?" hinted the second.</p>

<p>The tramp shook his head. He knew
nothing about Members and Delegates.</p>

<p>"I thought not," said Number One. "All
our Members and Delegates are quite of
respectable appearance."</p>

<p>"Got nothing to do," replied the Tramp,
laconically.</p>

<p>"Why don't you try the Colonies?" asked
Number Two. "There has been an immense
fall in the value of land in Australia. You
would get it cheap just now. Why not emigrate?
Why not acquire some land?"</p>

<p>"I don't want land, I want food!" returned the Tramp.</p>

<p>"Well, when we have a vacancy, you shall
become one of us. We eat, drink, and talk;
but we don't work. It's the best employment
out." And the Tramp found it so.</p>

<h2 class="sans">FROM GRAVE TO GAY; OR, THE SECRET OF SUCCESS.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Dash Blank</span> was a genius. He had been an immense success at
school, and had done admirably at the University. He then came up
to town and tried many things. He was a poet, a musician, an
artist, an inventor. And everyone he knew, said it was absolutely
wonderful, and that he should make a fortune. But just at the
moment he had a fair income, which had been left to him by his
deceased relative, and there was no occasion to augment his means.
On the contrary, if anything, his accomplishments were rather a loss
to him than a gain. So the situation existed for a time.</p>

<p>Then came a crash in the City, and poor <span class="sc">Dash Blank</span> found himself
penniless. It was then he tried to turn his talents to account,
but found that their market value was <i>nil</i>, or even less.</p>

<p>But, fortunately, he was "such a genius," and to persons of that
class often come what may be termed happy thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dash Blank</span> disappeared&mdash;completely, absolutely. His absence
remained unnoticed for some time, and then, of a sudden, his death
got into the papers. It was copied from one journal to another,
until the intelligence was conveyed from one end of the Empire to
the other. Then some one made the discovery that <span class="sc">Dash Blank</span>
had not been appreciated. Immediately all his brilliant failures
were unearthed, and advertised into popularity. His poems on
republication realised hundreds, and his pictures thousands; his
wonderful invention was patented, turned into a Company of
Limited Liability, and quickly realised a fortune. <span class="sc">Dash Blank</span>
was a name to conjure with&mdash;it was typical of success.</p>

<p>At length a statue was erected to
his memory, and the unveiling became
an important function. All sorts
of smart people were present, and the
finest things imaginable were said
about his career. When it was all
over, the Sculptor was
left alone with what had
been recently termed his "masterpiece."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/089a-500.png"><img src="images/089a-200.png" width="200" height="288" alt="Dash Blank" /></a></div>

<p>"No," said he; "it is
not a bit like poor <span class="sc">Dash</span>.
I never could get his expression."</p>

<p>"It's not bad," observed
a man in a cloak,
who had come up while
he was murmuring, and
who now stood beside him;
"not at all bad, considering
he never gave you a sitting."</p>

<p>"That's true enough,"
replied the Sculptor; "but how did
you know it?"</p>

<p>"Because I happen to be <span class="sc">Dash
Blank</span> himself!" and then the man
in the cloak threw off that covering,
and revealed his identity.</p>

<p>After this came an explanation. The genius noticing that when a
clever man dies there is always a run upon his works, died himself.
At any rate that was the impression in the minds of everyone save
a friendly executor, who collected the money for his estate. Then
the friendly executor paid the proceeds to the imaginary deceased.</p>

<p>"And shall you resume work?" asked the Sculptor, after he had
recovered from his astonishment.</p>

<p>"Not I. You need be under no alarm that anyone will compare
your portrait with the original. I have had enough of work, and
with my recently accumulated capital, shall try my hand at speculation.
Good bye, if you are in my neighbourhood, look me up.
You will find me anywhere between the Arctic and Antarctic
Zones." And then he went over to America, put his money into
wooden nutmegs, and promptly became a millionaire.</p>

<h2>MAKING THEM USEFUL.</h2>

<p>See in the papers that school-children at
Whissendine and elsewhere are taught gardening.
Excellent idea, this. Small Holdings
for Small Boys! Decide to try it at my
"Select Academy for the Sons of Gentlemen,"
as kitchen garden certainly <i>does</i> want attending
to, and I can't afford a gardener. Tell
the boys about it. They want to know if the
hour a day which I purpose to devote to
Agriculture is to take the place of
<i>Bradley's Latin Exercises</i>. On hearing
that it is, boys seem relieved, and <span class="sc">Smith
Junior</span> pronounces the scheme a "jolly
lark." I confess I am pleased to find this
appreciation of my new arrangement on the
part of the most troublesome urchin in the
school.</p>

<p><i>Next Day.</i>&mdash;All the boys are now provided
with separate plots, spades, rakes, and hoes.
Youth, in fact, is at the Plough, and
Myself at the Helm, so we ought to get on
all right. I purchase for them some young
cabbage-plants and cucumber-seeds, which
will go down as "extras" in the bills at the
end of Term. Boys very active first day.
<span class="sc">Smith Junior</span> breaks his spade, and gets
fifty lines. <span class="sc">Jones</span> astonishes me by talking
about "Three Acres and a Cow." Find
that his father is a strong Radical. Must
be careful what I say to <span class="sc">Jones</span>. The general
opinion seems to be that Gardening is better
than <i>Bradley's Exercises</i> "by long chalks."
Encouraging.</p>

<p><i>Week Later.</i>&mdash;In order to gain my prize
for best cabbages, boys have been stimulating
their growth with a guano made of chopped
bones, slate-pencil dust, and ink! Surprisingly
fine specimens in young <span class="sc">Dodger's</span>
allotment. Too good to be true. Go out to
inspect, take up one of his cabbages, and
find it has no roots. <span class="sc">Dodger</span> admits that
he bought them from village greengrocer.
I remark humorously to boys&mdash;"This is
<span class="sc">Dodger's</span> <i>plot</i>!" Boys cheer me, and, being
indignant at <span class="sc">Dodger's</span> cheating, make him&mdash;so
I hear afterwards&mdash;"run the gauntlet"
in the dormitory the same evening. Hope it
will do the little sneak good. <span class="sc">Smith Junior</span>
tries to do circus trick on garden roller.
Nearly killed. Two hundred lines, and a
page of <i>Bradley's Exercises</i>. Hear him
saying that "he wishes <span class="sc">Old Swats</span> (that's
me) would do his gardening himself, and see
how <i>he</i> likes it!" No, thanks.</p>

<p><i>End of the Experiment.</i>&mdash;Kitchen garden
a wreck! There has been a battle royal
between <span class="sc">Flashboyites</span> and <span class="sc">Smith Juniorites</span>.
<span class="sc">Flashboy</span> stole all the spades, and
entrenched himself in an earthwork, which
the other side stormed. <span class="sc">Smith Junior</span>
bleeding but triumphant. Says "gardening
is much better far than <i>Bradley's Exercises</i>."
Cucumbers (bought as missiles) and potatoes
lying all about. Several have got through
school-room windows! Letters arrive from
parents. Thought they would like the new
agricultural departure as teaching their boys
something really useful. But they don't.
Quite indignant. Say their sons are "not
intended for market-gardeners." <span class="sc">Smith
Junior's</span> parent says <i>his</i> boy is "meant for
the Church." Didn't know this before.
<span class="sc">Smith Junior</span> will be an ornament of the
Church Militant at any rate. Drop the gardening,
and go back to <i>Bradley</i>.</p>

<h3 class="sans">AUSTRALIA THE (WITHOUT) GOLDEN.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I see
that, with a view to economy,
the Victorian Legislature have
cut down the salary of their
future Governors to a reasonable
sum. Every one will
applaud an act inspired by so
worthy a motive. Still, as the
officials who have been thus
deprived of some of their
emoluments have a certain
state to keep up, I think it
would be only fair were that
state also to undergo revision.
With a view to assisting in so
desirable a programme, I jot
down a few suggestions.</p>

<p><i>Uniform.</i>&mdash;Future Governors
not to be required to wear
gold lace. Yellow braid to
be sparingly used in decorating
their frock-coats. Dirks
to be substituted for swords.
Cocked-hats no longer to be
trimmed with feathers.</p>

<p><i>Official Entertainments.</i>&mdash;Governors
no longer to be required
to ask Colonials to
dinner. Luncheons with chops
and steaks and boiled potatoes
to be substituted for extensive
<i>menus</i>. Balls to be given only
occasionally, and guests to be
served with the lightest of light
refreshments (sandwiches and
lemonade); and if dancing be
required, dancers to supply
their own orchestras.</p>

<p><i>Attending State Functions.</i>&mdash;Governors
no longer to be
expected to appear in carriage
and pair. Their Excellencies
to be entitled to use tram-cars,
omnibuses, and bicycles.
When laying a foundation-stone,
the Governors to be permitted
to wear double-soled
boots, and carry umbrellas.</p>

<p><i>Miscellaneous.</i>&mdash;To avoid
expense, salutes will be dispensed
with as much as possible.
When guns are fired, tubes to be used without cartridges.
Flags not to be flown in wet weather, and Chairs of State always
to be covered with brown holland. Gaslights to be sparingly
lighted, and wax-candles abolished.</p>

<p>There, my dear Sir, this should be a relief both to the goose and
the gander. It is quite right to economise, but it is a little strange
to find that we get our first hint in this direction from the Antipodes.</p>

<p class="author">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="sc">Gay without Pay</span>.</p>

I 'eard as her Ladyship was going to give a Play in the Grounds&mdash;a
<i>Pastoral</i> Play, they told me&mdash;so I made so bold as jest to come

<h3>STILL WILDER IDEAS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Possibilities for the next O. Wilde Play.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number One.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Let's
come into the garden, <span class="sc">Maudle</span>.
I adore the garden.
Don't you know that the book
of at least one good play begins
with some epigrams in the
garden, and ends with&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number Two.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Recitations&mdash;strictly
puritanical.
Well, let's go into the garden:
there's nothing but Nature to
look at there, so we will discuss&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number One.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The
picture shows. It seems to
me there are two principles in
modern art. The first is&mdash;give
a picture a good name, and
they'll hang it.</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number Two.</i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What's&mdash;ahem!&mdash;what <i>is</i> in
a name?</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number One.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Usually
a good deal more than is
in the picture.</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number Two.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And
the second principle?</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number One.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Art
is short, and the life (of the
average Academician) is
long.</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number Two.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ah,
well. I suppose I shall have
to ask you sooner or later to
define Art.</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number One.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly.
Art is that which
invariably goes one better
than Nature.</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number Two (with
a sigh).</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;And what is Nature?</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number One.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nature
is that which is not so
natural as it is painted.</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number Two (with
a groan).</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;What about truth
in Art then?</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number One.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ah!
Truth is that one infirmity of
a noble mind.</p>

<p><i>Puppet Number Two.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Truth is nothing if not respectable.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 3em;"><i>Puppet Number One.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, respectability is an affectation,
of cynics, dramatic authors&mdash;and other people of no importance
generally. <span style="float: right">[<i>Exeunt severally. Curtain.</i></span></p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, August 14.</i>&mdash;Quite shocked to see
<span class="sc">Asher</span> to-day. Strong constitution and a happy disposition united
to make him a picture of buoyant health. Observing him walk up
floor of House just now, hardly knew him. Shoulders bowed; arms
hanging limp; cheeks sallow; an unspeakable sorrow in his dimmed
eyes.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mr. <span class="sc">Solicitor</span>?" I asked, instinctively
falling into the whispering tone proper in sick rooms. "Is it the
state of Scotch business that weighs upon your mind? or is it true,
as whispered, that necessity has been discovered for bringing in Bill
amending the Borough Police and Health Act, 1892, with its 435
clauses?"</p>

<p>"No," said <span class="sc">Asher</span>; "I'm thinking of neither. My thoughts
tend in quite another direction. My heart is at Deeside, my heart
is not here. I have a moor there; you understand me&mdash;not a person
of dark complexion, who, after much conversation, disposes of his
wife with the assistance of a pillow. But a stretch of moorland,
gorse-scented, grouse-haunted. I awoke early on Saturday morning
hearing the popping of the guns in far-off Aboyne. Mere fancy, of
course. You remember <span class="sc">Charles Lamb's</span> story about supping with
some Scotchmen, and incidentally observing he only wished, to
make the joy complete, that <span class="sc">Burns</span> were there? One by one the Scotchmen
got up and explained to him that <span class="sc">Burns</span> had been dead for ever
so many years, and that it was practically impossible, in view of the
circumstances, that he could have been present; even, one of
them added, supposing they knew <span class="sc">Burns</span>, and it had occurred to
them to invite him. So you will say that Deeside, being hundreds
of miles away, I could not hear the birds on the wing, or the pottering
of the guns. In a sense, that is true; but I heard them all the
same; worse still, heard them when I was in church yesterday, and
should have been hearing something else. I wouldn't mind missing
a day, a week, or, in the service of my <span class="sc">Queen</span> and country, a fortnight.
What I see, and what gars me greet, is the endless vista of
nights and days we shall spend here. If we get any shooting at all
we shall begin with the pheasants.</p>

<p class="center">Admiral Field as the honest British Sailor.</p></div>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Just before eight bells, when all hands were piped
below, Admiral <span class="sc">Field</span> turned up in favourite character as the
honest British sailor. Rather modelled on transpontine style; a
little unnecessarily noisy; too humorously aggressive; hopelessly
obvious. But in present circumstances House grateful for anything;
gleefully laughed whilst the Admiral shivered his timbers,
talked about losing his soundings in a fog, declared against all shams,
referred to himself as "honest and modest sailor who believed in
straightforward action, and refused to have his eyes blinded by
abstract proposals."</p>

<p>That last phrase didn't sound seafaring, but, as another honest
sailor was accustomed to say, its bearings lay in the application of
it. Motion before House was to eliminate Second Chamber from
Home-Rule scheme; brought forward by Radicals; situation
difficult for Opposition. If they voted against the Government they
would be declaring against principle of House of Lords. If they voted
with them they would be approving a proposition of the hated Bill.
<span class="sc">Joseph</span> judiciously got out of difficulty by declining to vote at all.
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> elaborately explained that in going into Lobby with
the Radicals he was voting against a concrete proposal and in favour
of an abstract principle. This too subtle for <span class="sc">Courtney</span>, who
announced his intention of voting with Government who happened
to agree with him in approving principle of Second Chamber. It
was amid these cross blades that the Admiral, hitching up his
trousers, danced a hornpipe. <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> attempting to bring House
back to more serious views, Members with one accord rushed into
Lobby, and Government came out with majority of 83.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Seventh night in Report Stage Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;"Whew!" said the Member for <span class="sc">Sark</span>. "I don't
know what will become of us if things go on much longer like this.
With a <span class="sc">Premier</span> over eighty, and the thermometer over 90, the
situation is at least unusual. Even <span class="sc">Joseph</span> not able to maintain his
favourite attitude, grafted on the iced cucumber. Just now
Mr. G. made a passing remark, quite mild compared with <span class="sc">Joey's</span>
own sly hits. J. C. up on instant, with boding brow and angry
plaint that Mr. G. had attempted to slay him with a sneer."</p>

<p>"Yes," said <span class="sc">Plunket</span>, "times <i>are</i> hot. I don't know what we
should do without <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>. The spectacle of his white
ducks is to me as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. They
talk about an army of men in the basement working machinery
that keeps the temperature ten degrees below what it is marked
on the Terrace. Also there is, it seems, a ton and a half of ice
melting in ventilating chambers at the taxpayers' expense for our
comfort. But I don't think ice is in it with <span class="sc">Tommy's</span> ducks. Even
if they were stationary it would be something. But observe how,
coming and going, <span class="sc">Tommy's</span> brain an argosy of great thoughts, the
ducks seem to skim over our prosaic floor, calling up even to the
unimaginative mind a vision of deep, tree-shaded, quietly-rippling
Broad, over which the wild duck swiftly moves, waving white
wings."</p>

<p>Only <span class="sc">Plunket</span>, I fancy, could evolve poesy out of to-night's
scene; hot above precedent, dull beyond endurance.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Plunket's</span> duck picture cool and refreshing. But," said
<span class="sc">Edward of Armagh</span>, drawing on his military experiences, "what
we're doing just now may be much more accurately described as the
goose step."</p>

<p>Quite so. We sit all afternoon and far into the night, always
talking, sometimes dividing; every appearance of motion, no
advance; feet lifted with due sign of walking, but when midnight
strikes and parade dismissed we are found posted exactly at the
same spot as that on which we took our stand at half-past three in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>If Mr. G. means business the sooner he gets about it the better.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a href="images/096b-800.png"><img src="images/096b-250.png" width="250" height="283" alt="Swift MacNeill refuses to be named." /></a>
<p class="center">Swift MacNeill refuses to be named.</p></div>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;None.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Mr. G. does mean business. Commences on Monday,
when Motion will be made to close Report Stage of Home-Rule Bill.
Mere reference to it set House bubbling with excitement. Mr. G.'s
proposed Resolution not yet drafted. "You know how it is," he
said, smiling blandly at <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>; "you've had a good deal
of experience in drawing Resolutions of this nature." But if
Ministers not ready with their Resolution, <span class="sc">Joseph</span> prepared with
Amendment. Read it out amid lively interruption.</p>

<p>Conversation later conducted with much vigour across the Gangway,
where, a fortnight ago, <span class="sc">Gunter</span> received an Irish Member (not
iced) full in pit of stomach. Once the Blameless <span class="sc">Bartley</span> signalled
out Member for South Donegal, mentioning him by name as responsible
for particular exclamations. "Don't presume to mention my
name," said <span class="sc">MacNeill</span>, leaning across gangway.</p>

<p>"Look here, <span class="sc">Bartley</span>," said <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>, "if you're going
on that tack, you must come and sit at this side. When I saw
<span class="sc">MacNeill</span> open his mouth to speak, I confess I thought I was going
to be swallowed whole. You sit here; there's more of you."</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
